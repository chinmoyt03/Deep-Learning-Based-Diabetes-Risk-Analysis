•	To develop a predictive model that can accurately assess the risk of diabetes occurrence in individuals based on a range of factors such as demographic information, medical history etc.

•	To thoroughly research and compare various cutting-edge techniques within the realm of classification models. This will involve an in-depth analysis of the strengths, weaknesses, and potential pitfalls associated with each model.

•	To meticulously calculate and compare the error rates of different models in order to gain a comprehensive understanding of their predictive capabilities. This will involve rigorous testing and validation procedures to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the results.

•	To explore and establish correlations between all relevant parameters, with the aim of uncovering potential connections and patterns that may contribute to the risk of diabetes.

•	To evaluate the confusion matrix for each classification model and identify the most effective one based on its ability to accurately predict the occurrence of diabetes while minimizing false positives and false negatives. This thorough evaluation will aid in the selection of the most robust and reliable model for practical implementation.
