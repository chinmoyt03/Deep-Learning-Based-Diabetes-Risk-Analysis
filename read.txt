Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. It is a condition where the body cannot produce or use insulin properly, leading to an increase in blood sugar levels. If left untreated or undiagnosed, it can lead to severe complications, including heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, and many more.
Identifying diabetes can be a challenging and time-consuming process. It often involves patient referral to a diagnostic center and consultation with a doctor. However, with the emergence of predictive analytics in the healthcare industry, physicians can now use data to make timely decisions about a patient's health and condition, including the diagnosis of diabetes.
The aim of this project is to develop a model that can reliably predict the presence of diabetes in patients. To achieve this, the dataset is divided into two parts - the training dataset, and the testing dataset. The training dataset is used to fit the model, while the testing dataset is used for tuning the model's hyperparameters and comparing its performance with the training dataset. 
In order to detect diabetes at an early stage, this project utilizes deep learning algorithms, including Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Transfer Learning. These algorithms are specifically designed to analyze large amounts of data and identify patterns that can be used to accurately predict outcomes. The project uses the Pima Indians Diabetes Database for the experiments. The model diagnoses whether a patient may be affected by diabetes by applying eight diagnostic parameters (Glucose, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, Insulin level, BMI, Diabetes Pedigree Function, age, number of pregnancies) in the dataset.
After the model has undergone the training and testing processes, a confusion matrix is generated to analyze its performance. The confusion matrix allows for the calculation of important metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and f1 score, which collectively provide a comprehensive understanding of the model's predictive capabilities and overall effectiveness. The accuracy of the algorithms used in this project is compared and discussed to determine which algorithm is better suited for diabetes prediction.
